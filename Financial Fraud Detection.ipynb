    "The Logistic Regression model achieves an accuracy of 94.2%, accurately classifying non-fraudulent transactions (class 0) but showing limitations in identifying fraudulent transactions (class 1), with low precision, recall, and F1-score for class 1. On the other hand, the Random Forest model achieves a slightly lower accuracy of 90.25%. It exhibits better performance in identifying non-fraudulent transactions but struggles with classifying fraudulent transactions, resulting in low precision, recall, and F1-score for class 1. In summary, both models excel in identifying non-fraudulent transactions but face challenges in accurately detecting fraudulent transactions, suggesting the need for further model refinement or alternative approaches for handling imbalanced datasets."
